'''
This is a pretty neat rectangle collision detection function.
Note: I did not invent this system or anything. It is a well known technique.
It overlays a grid over the rectangles and checks to see if any cell has more than one rectangle in it.
Then we do the naive overlap check on any rectangles which share a cell.

There are numerous performance gains that could me made, but were entirely unnecessary for this.
